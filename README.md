# Range Select


In the file testData.txt there are several records of the form "Ax,By,Cz". We want to display on an html page these records in a table with the possibility of filtering the values based on "select" type inputs:

* When selecting a new value from the selections at the top of the page, its content will change according to the selection. Both the content of the other "select" elements and the content of the table will be modified.
